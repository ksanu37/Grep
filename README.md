# Grep
A C++ Program to implement the functionality of the grep command.

The GrepCommandLine.cpp takes input from the command line and perfoms the grep operation. 

Assumption: The command line execution would be something like the following:
$ g++ main.cpp -o main 
$ ./main grep -i newLine sample.txt



The GrepUserInput.cpp takes input from the user during runtime and performs the grep operation.
